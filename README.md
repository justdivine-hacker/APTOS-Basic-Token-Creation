# Basic Token Creation on Aptos

A comprehensive Move smart contract for creating and managing custom tokens on the Aptos blockchain with complete administrative control and token lifecycle management.

## Description

This project provides a robust smart contract module built in Move language for the Aptos blockchain that enables anyone to create, manage, and control their own custom tokens. The smart contract offers a complete token creation framework with essential features including minting, burning, transferring, and administrative controls.

### Key Features

- **Token Creation**: Initialize custom tokens with configurable parameters (name, symbol, decimals, initial supply)
- **Minting & Burning**: Create new tokens or destroy existing ones with proper authorization
- **Transfer System**: Secure token transfers between registered accounts
- **Administrative Controls**: Owner-only functions for minting and account management
- **Account Management**: Freeze/unfreeze accounts to prevent token operations
- **Supply Monitoring**: Optional supply tracking and monitoring capabilities
- **View Functions**: Query token balances, registration status, and ownership information
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in test functions to verify all functionalities

### Technical Highlights

- Built using Aptos Move language for maximum security and efficiency
- Utilizes Aptos Framework's coin module for standard token operations
- Implements proper access controls and error handling
- Follows Move's ownership and resource management principles
- Includes extensive documentation and test coverage

## Vision

Our vision is to democratize token creation on the Aptos blockchain by providing a simple, secure, and feature-rich platform that empowers developers, businesses, and communities to launch their own digital assets without requiring deep blockchain expertise.

### Core Principles

- **Accessibility**: Make token creation accessible to developers of all skill levels
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures and follow best practices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Aptos CLI installed and configured
- Move development environment set up
- Basic understanding of blockchain and smart contracts

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `aptos move compile` to compile the smart contract
4. Run `aptos move test` to execute test cases
5. Deploy using `aptos move publish`

### Usage Example

```move
// Create a new token
create_token<MyCoin>(
    &signer,
    b"My Token",
    b"MTK",
    8,           // 8 decimal places
    1000000,     // Initial supply
    true         // Monitor supply
);

// Register to receive tokens
register<MyCoin>(&user_account);

// Transfer tokens
transfer<MyCoin>(&from_account, to_address, amount);
```
